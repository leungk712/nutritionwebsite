# [Nutrition Website] (https://leungk712.github.io/nutritionwebsite/)

This project combines my love for nutrition as well as my love for coding. This project is far from being completed, but as a
Registered Dietitian, I believe that nutrition information should be provided in an accurate manner for people all around the 
world regardless of financial circumstances. 

The nutrition website will contain sections on vitamins, minerals, medical nutrition therapy, scientific articles and resources.
My goal is to provide this information in a way that's easy to understand for the general public. My vision for this project
will provide an overview of what foods we eat and why it matters. Information in regards to plant based diets, how to treat
diabetes through nutrition, heart health, and so much more. I hope to dive into scientific articles and providing accurate 
information on what these articles mean as I am well aware that nutrition information can be so inconsistent throughout the
internet. 

The project will ultimately encompass HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As my skills develop, I hope to someday make this into a full on 
dynamic webpage where people can create an account, comment on research articles, nutrition news, etc. and provide a space for
a community where people can learn, exchange information, and strive for longevity. 

This project is moving quite slow as I have struggled to find ways to implement JavaScript. I have thought about creating a 
diabetes checklist calculator/form similar to the American Diabetic Association's diabetes checklist. I have thought about
creating a nutrition flip card game where people can look a certain pictures of food and group them into whichever food group
fits best. Although a static page with just information will be fine, I want to brainstorm and make this page interactive 
with easy user experience.

The benefits of this webpage can be so much for people who may have access to a computer but not financial access towards a 
Registered Dietitian. My hope is that this can be a education tool for many communities out there. This will benefit me in 
continuing to hone my coding skills while sharing information that can help others.
