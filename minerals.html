        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Why minerals? Minerals help your body grow, develop, and stay healthy. Minerals can be used from building bones, help build energy for the body, send nerve impulses throughout the body.</p>
        <p>There are two kinds of minerals: Macrominerals and trace minerals. Macro means "large" in Greek meaning that your body requires more of the macrominerals than trace minerals. Macrominerals are made up of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride. Trace minerals includes iron, manganese, copper, iodine, zinc.</p>

                   <p>Strong bones and teeth! Calcium is such an important mineral to have in our bodies. Our nervous system, muscles, heart, and bones use calcium. Vitamin D is needed to help increase calcium absorption!</p>
