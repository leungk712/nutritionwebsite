          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>Why minerals? Minerals help your body grow, develop, and stay healthy. Minerals are used by the body to do a lot of things, such as building bones, helping provide energy for the body, and sending nerve impulses throughout the body.</p>
          <p>There are two kinds of minerals: Macrominerals and trace minerals. Macro means "large" in Greek meaning that your body needs more of the macrominerals than trace minerals. Macrominerals include calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride. Trace minerals include iron, manganese, copper, iodine, zinc.</p>
